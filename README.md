# Graph Topology Documentation

This repo provides the ability to make a dataset of scene graph for RL in VLN.

## Contents

### data/
This directory contains text files representing different graph structures. Each file follows a specific format to define nodes and edges.

<!-- ### scripts/
This directory includes Python scripts for analyzing and visualizing graph data.

- `analyze.py`: Script to perform various analyses on the graph data.
- `visualize.py`: Script to create visual representations of the graphs.

### results/
This directory stores the output of the analysis scripts, including CSV files with analysis results. -->

## To Do

- [ ] Collect images into a data folder, associated with which node it suppose to be at
- [ ] Update the code so that it can provide image scene for each node instead of number only

## Tested

- Python 3.8
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)

## Installation

Install the required Python packages using pip:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
